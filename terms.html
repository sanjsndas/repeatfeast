                    <p>Before filing any claim against RepeatFeast, you agree to try to resolve the dispute by contacting us at disputes@repeatfeast.com. Most disputes can be resolved informally. For any claims that aren't resolved informally, you and RepeatFeast agree to resolve them through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California.</p>

If we make material changes, we will notify you through the Service or by other means to give you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective.

                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RepeatFeast regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of RepeatFeast to be effective. Our rights and remedies under these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Even if we don't enforce a provision, we may still enforce it later.</p>

The invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.</p>
